my resume, things i think you should know about me, and books i take from

I like free open source software, as such I use Linux as my OS on my machine, powered mainly by terminal use and any applications made to make things easier. I find this important for my workflow as it allows me to do whatever I want whenever I want, but things aren't in my face that don't need to be, which makes a positive difference in productivity for my young mind to flourish.

The books I try to stick with in my life are purely philosophy, I'll list them in order of familiarity. I've read many other books in the past, some for entertainment and some for self-help but they are generally much too external in relation to a normal person's life. What I mean by this is they are disconnected from the machines people actually want to be in tune with, in favor of acquiring capital than creating a life worth living. I'd recommend anyone to resist setting others' standard as their own, it should be obvious why.

* Plato (Theaetetus, Timaeus, Parmenides, Sophist)
* Kant (Critique of Pure Reason)
* Spinoza (Ethics)
* Ulysse Carri√®re (Technically Man Dwells)
* Deleuze & Guattari (Anti-Oedipus)
* Deleuze & Guattari (What is Philosophy?)
* Deleuze (Difference & Repetition)
* Nietzsche (Will to Power, Genealogy of Morals, Beyond Good & Evil)
* Proclus (Elements of Theology)
* Marx (Grundrisse, Capital Vol 1)

at this instant, i'm into shorter essays and rereading very selective texts. exploring other areas of philosophy can be tempting, but i'm restraining myself intentionally in order to perfect understanding of the texts to the level they deserve.

coding concepts i like
1. code maintenance-machines break down over time and code is no different!
2. speed and performance are necessary to any project -- may require lower level understanding
3. more features are always a way to improve past a fundamental base, they give apps more reality
4. inadequate coding practices must be destroyed.
