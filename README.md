my resume, things i think you should know about me, and books i take from

I know very little!!! I say this with excitement, that knowledge is attainable through a quest that one can undertake.
what else do i get excited about? open source and free software!

I like free open source software, as such I use Linux as my OS on my machine, coupled with Arch & i3 window manager. I find this important for my workflow as it allows me to do whatever I want whenever I want, but things aren't in my face that don't need to be, which makes an astronomical difference in productivity for my young mind to flourish.

The books I try to stick with in my life are purely philosophy, I'll list them in order of familiarity. I don't read philosophy to be above others as I have noticed some technocrats do, I'm completely indifferent to power :) i do it simply because i love it, i love the craft of writing, the concepts explored, and it gives me a whooole lot to chew on mentally so i can utilize boredom to its fullest.

1. Deleuze & Guattari (Anti-Oedipus)
2. Deleuze & Guattari (What is Philosophy?)
2. Deleuze (Difference & Repetition)
3. Plato (Theaetetus, Republic)
4. Nietzsche (Genealogy of Morals, Beyond Good & Evil, Will to Power)
5. Spinoza (Ethics)
6. Marx (Grundrisse)
7. Kant (Critique of Pure Reason)
7. Proclus (Elements of Theology)

coding concepts i like
1. code maintenance-machines break down over time and code is no different!
2. speed and performance are necessary to any project -- may require lower level understanding
3. more features are always a way to improve past a fundamental base, they give apps more reality
