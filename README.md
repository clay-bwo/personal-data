my resume, things i think you should know about me, and books i take from

I know very little!!! I say this with excitement, that knowledge is attainable through a quest that one can undertake.

I like free open source software, as such I use Linux as my OS on my machine, coupled with Arch & i3 window manager.

The books I try to stick with in my life are purely philosophy, I'll list them in order of familiarity. I don't read philosophy to be above others as I have noticed some technocrats do, I'm completely indifferent to power :)

1. Deleuze (Anti-Oedipus)
2. Deleuze (Difference & Repetition)
3. Plato (Theaetetus, Republic)
4. Nietzsche (Genealogy of Morals, Beyond Good & Evil, Will to Power)
5. Spinoza (Ethics)
6. Marx (Grundrisse)
7. Proclus (Elements of Theology)
